# SQL_Alchemy Project

In this project, I used SQL Alchemy to connect to a SQLite DB and work with the data in python. From there I designed a query to get historical weather data for Hawaii from various reporting stations and plotted records of this data using matplotlib. I created charts showing precipitation and temperature data from the previous 12 months.

Next I developed Flask API routes based on the queries I developed. I created four different API routes including one that accepts start and end dates that returns the temperature average, minimum, and maximum over the selected period of time.
